#Spotify-Music-Developer-App

This app is a react app that is a developer version of the Spotify.With this app, firstly the users need to get their client id from spotify developer application link. After that the users need to initialize the client_Id with it,and then run the app.
This app allows users to search music and add playlist from local server to the original spotify server

NOTE:The first search makes or establishes connection with the user's account,so it wont show up the search data,so you need to search after that for the desired music list.
